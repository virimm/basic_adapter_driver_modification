Modify Microsoft Basic Display Driver to get a better resolution
=================================

Microsoft has introduced a new out-of-box driver, Microsoft Basic Display Adapter Driver. This driver is used during installation, a suitable driver is not found(always old adapters no longer supported by manufacturers), safe mode. And you can always use it when your graphics adapter has a buggy driver.
However, as its name, basic display adapter, it provides 640*480 when boot in headless mode, that is, no monitor is attached to a systtem. And actually, we usually put our servers, HTPC(it become headless if you switch to other source in your TV) in this mode.
By modifying the default value in BasicDisplay.sys, we can change this. After a bit googling, 1366*736 is most used resolution, and 1600*900/1920*1080 is used in recent HD monitors.

use IDA, according the function names, we can easily reach here:

modify 280h to width,1e0h to height.

For your convenience, I have patched x64/x86, and there are 3 resolutions mod in compressed files.

1. Download this package

2. Change your current adapter driver from a buggy driver, e.g. Intel driver. skip this if you are using Basic Adapter Driver already. reboot, and you should get a very low resolution at 640*480( if you are remoting). It’s best to do a check in device manager, it’s using basic adapter driver.

3. Take a file you wanted from the compressed file, go to C:\Windows\System32\Drivers, modify the files security, take the ownership from TrustInstaller to Administrators, and assign Administrators to Full Access. replace the file, reboot. now you can get the respective resolution according what files you used.
